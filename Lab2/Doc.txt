Symbol table - implemented as a hash table composed of a HashMap with the key
equal to the hashing value of the identifier and the value consisting of a list
made up by all the identifiers that have the same hashing value;
STKey is a class that wraps the indexes in which the identifier can be found
-add : adds a new identifier to the ST (if the identifier exists it is not added) and returns the STKey associated to its indexes;
-remove : removes an identifier from the ST; if the identifier is not present a STKey with indexes -1 is returned
-get : retrieves the STKey associated to an identifier; if the identifier is not present a STKey with indexes -1 is returned
